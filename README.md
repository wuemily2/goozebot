# goozebot
dumb goose
gooze very dumb
yeet

This is just a gag program written with the discord.py library for usage as a "discord bot" on the popular communication service called Discord.

The code structure and commits are probably really bad. I blame the geese.

The code can be run using goozeTest.py; I never bothered to change the name.

BTW I got the base file, goozeTest.py from someone else whose github name I don't know.

This is by no means a professional looking repository. I made it quite a few months ago with my miniscule knowledge of programming and git commits.

Please make fun of my repository.
